1276	CK	Let's try something.
1277	CK	I have to go to sleep.
1284	CK	I will be back soon.
1287	CK	This is never going to end.
1288	CK	I just don't know what to say.
1290	CK	I was in the mountains.
1292	CK	I don't know if I have the time.
1295	CK	You're in better shape than I am.
1296	CK	You are in my way.
1302	CK	That won't happen.
1308	CK	I miss you.
1309	CK	I'll call them tomorrow when I come back.
1311	CK	You should sleep.
1312	CK	I'm going to go.
1313	CK	I told them to send me another ticket.
1315	CK	I can't live that kind of life.
1316	CK	I once wanted to be an astrophysicist.
1317	CK	I never liked biology.
1318	CK	The last person I told my idea to thought I was nuts.
1322	CK	Most people think I'm crazy.
1326	CK	Are you sure?
1329	CK	Hurry up.
1330	CK	It doesn't surprise me.
1333	CK	It depends on the context.
1335	CK	That's the stupidest thing I've ever said.
1337	CK	When I grow up, I want to be a king.
1339	CK	I'm so fat.
1344	CK	That was probably what influenced their decision.
1345	CK	I've always wondered what it'd be like to have siblings.
1347	CK	It would take forever for me to explain everything.
1353	CK	Let's consider the worst that could happen.
1354	CK	How many close friends do you have?
1356	CK	This is always the way it has been.
1357	CK	I think it is best not to be impolite.
1359	CK	I'd be unhappy, but I wouldn't kill myself.
1360	CK	Back in high school, I got up at 6 a.m. every morning.
1366	CK	In order to do that, you have to take risks.
1368	CK	Why do you ask?
1372	CK	Whenever I find something I like, it's too expensive.
1373	CK	How long did you stay?
1376	CK	Humans were never meant to live forever.
1378	CK	I think I have a theory about that.
1379	CK	That is intriguing.
1383	CK	I didn't know where it came from.
1385	CK	This is not important.
1386	CK	I didn't like it.
1387	CK	She's asking how that's possible.
1390	CK	There's a problem there that you don't see.
1391	CK	You can do it.
1392	CK	My physics teacher doesn't care if I skip classes.
1393	CK	I wish I could go to Japan.
1395	CK	I have to go to bed.
1397	CK	I won't ask you anything else today.
1398	CK	It may freeze next week.
1399	CK	Even though he apologized, I'm still furious.
1402	CK	That wasn't my intention.
1403	CK	Thanks for your explanation.
1408	CK	I don't know what you mean.
1414	CK	There are many words that I don't understand.
1420	CK	Can it be phrased in another way?
1421	CK	No one will know.
1423	CK	It seems interesting to me.
1425	CK	I like candlelight.
1426	CK	What did you answer?
1431	CK	Where is the problem?
1433	CK	It's not much of a surprise, is it?
1434	CK	I love you.
1435	CK	I don't like you anymore.
1436	CK	I am curious.
1437	CK	Congratulations!
1438	CK	I don't want to wait that long.
1439	CK	Why don't you come visit us?
1442	CK	I shouldn't have logged off.
1443	CK	I don't know what to do anymore.
1445	CK	I hate chemistry.
1446	CK	I didn't want this to happen.
1449	CK	What other options do I have?
1451	CK	I have nothing better to do.
1452	CK	I can't explain it either.
1458	CK	It's not something anyone can do.
1459	CK	I don't know if I still have it.
1460	CK	What do you think I've been doing?
1461	CK	Don't underestimate my power.
1462	CK	My mom doesn't speak English very well.
1464	CK	I was wondering if you were going to show up today.
1467	CK	All you can do is trust one another.
1468	CK	Everyone wants to meet you. You're famous!
1469	CK	Why are you sorry for something you haven't done?
1473	CK	What keeps you up so late?
1474	CK	You'd be surprised what you can learn in a week.
1475	CK	I don't have anyone who'd travel with me.
1476	CK	You're not fast enough.
1481	CK	Tomorrow, he will land on the moon.
1482	CK	I don't speak Japanese.
1483	CK	This is a pun.
1484	CK	Nobody understands me.
1485	CK	I learned to live without her.
1487	CK	I have too many things on my mind these days.
1488	CK	I just wanted to check my email.
1496	CK	It would take me too much time to explain to you why it's not going to work.
1499	CK	Are you referring to me?
1501	CK	It can't be!
1504	CK	Would you like something to drink?
1521	CK	Please don't cry.
1522	CK	Let me know if there is anything I can do.
1525	CK	Class doesn't begin until eight-thirty.
1526	CK	I want a boat that will take me far away from here.
1535	CK	If you see a mistake, then please correct it.
1540	CK	Why don't we go home?
1541	CK	I'm sorry, I can't stay long.
1542	CK	Ten years is a long time to wait.
1544	CK	One million people lost their lives in the war.
1561	CK	Did you miss me?
1563	CK	Are they all the same?
1566	CK	I'll take him.
1567	CK	It's a surprise.
1568	CK	That's a good idea!
1577	CK	Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
1578	CK	They say love is blind.
1579	CK	Oh, I'm sorry.
1581	CK	The only useful answers are those that raise new questions.
1585	CK	How long does it take to get to the station?
1594	CK	May I ask a question?
1596	CK	It's quite difficult to master French in 2 or 3 years.
1597	CK	It's impossible for me to explain it to you.
1599	CK	It would be fun to see how things change over the years.
1600	CK	I would never have guessed that.
1601	CK	Imagination affects every aspect of our lives.
1602	CK	You'll forget about me someday.
1603	CK	That is rather unexpected.
1604	CK	I wonder how long it's going to take.
1605	CK	I can't live without a TV.
1606	CK	I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you.
1607	CK	Nothing is achieved without effort.
1610	CK	Let me know if I need to make any changes.
1612	CK	We can't sleep because of the noise.
1615	CK	Do whatever he tells you.
1616	CK	I can walk to school in 10 minutes.
1617	CK	It took me more than two hours to translate a few pages of English.
1618	CK	It is already eleven.
1622	CK	What do you want?
1625	CK	I have a bone to pick with you.
1626	CK	Do you need me to give you some money?
1630	CK	I have a dream.
1644	CK	You look stupid.
1645	CK	I think I'm gonna go to sleep.
1647	CK	I like it very much.
1649	CK	How do you say that in Italian?
1650	CK	I have to go shopping. I'll be back in an hour.
1651	CK	Is it far from here?
1652	CK	These things aren't mine!
1654	CK	Would you like to dance with me?
1658	CK	Italy is a very beautiful country.
1660	CK	I'd like to stay for one night.
1662	CK	Is there a youth hostel near here?
1663	CK	Where are the showers?
1664	CK	Open your mouth!
1665	CK	Is it bad?
1666	CK	I have lost my wallet.
1674	CK	There are too many things to do!
1679	CK	Thanks to you I've lost my appetite.
1680	CK	I really need to hit somebody.
1688	CK	It's so hot that you could cook an egg on the hood of a car.
1689	CK	It is very hot today.
1690	CK	Nobody came.
1698	CK	Look at me when I talk to you!
1699	CK	What would the world be without women?
1700	CK	What if you gave a speech and nobody came?
1701	CK	I don't know what to say to make you feel better.
1703	CK	I was trying to kill time.
1704	CK	How did you come up with this crazy idea?
1705	CK	I'm tired.
1706	CK	Who wants some hot chocolate?
1709	CK	When do we arrive?
1710	CK	The check, please.
1712	CK	I have a headache.
1716	CK	How are you? Did you have a good trip?
1717	CK	I don't feel well.
1718	CK	Call the police!
1721	CK	My shoes are too small. I need new ones.
1722	CK	We're getting out of here. The cops are coming.
1723	CK	Merry Christmas!
1726	CK	You should have listened to me.
1729	CK	What does it involve?
1736	CK	He would be glad to hear that.
1739	CK	Don't ask what they think. Ask what they do.
1746	CK	Anything that can be misunderstood will be.
1748	CK	Why is life so full of suffering?
1753	CK	I would like to give him a present for his birthday.
1754	CK	I'm starving!
1758	CK	I am married and have two children.
1759	CK	He plays the piano very well.
1761	CK	I'd like to study in Paris.
1762	CK	You don't know who I am.
1763	CK	Why don't you eat vegetables?
1764	CK	Why do people go to the movies?
1765	CK	I'm undressing.
1771	CK	The wind calmed down.
1775	CK	Where there's a will, there's a way.
1777	CK	Rome wasn't built in a day.
1783	CK	That was the best day of my life.
1784	CK	I don't understand German.
1785	CK	I made my decision.
1786	CK	I give you my word.
1801	CK	I find foreign languages very interesting.
1803	CK	Take a book and read it.
1809	CK	The vacation is over now.
1812	CK	That's the absolute truth.
1813	CK	It's cold.
1814	CK	I'm thirsty.
1817	CK	When you can't do what you want, you do what you can.
1818	CK	Give him an inch and he'll take a yard.
1822	CK	You're my type.
1823	CK	You're irresistible.
